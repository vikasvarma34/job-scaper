# Job Scraper & Application Assistant

This project is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to automate and enhance the job searching process, primarily focusing on LinkedIn. It scrapes job postings, parses resumes, scores job suitability against a candidate's resume, manages job application statuses, and can even generate custom PDF resumes. The system leverages AI (Google Gemini) for advanced text processing and Supabase for data storage.

## Features

- **Job Scraping**: Automatically scrapes job postings. ([scraper.py](scraper.py))
- **Resume Parsing**:
  - Extracts text from PDF resumes using `pdfplumber`. ([resume_parser.py](resume_parser.py))
  - Utilizes Google Gemini AI to parse resume text into structured data ([parse_resume_with_ai.py](parse_resume_with_ai.py))
- **Job Scoring**: Scores job descriptions against a parsed resume using AI to determine suitability. ([score_jobs.py](score_jobs.py))
- **Universal LLM Support**: Supports 400+ model providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Groq, etc.) via a unified abstraction layer. ([llm_client.py](llm_client.py))
- **Job Management**:
  - Tracks the status of job applications.
  - Marks old or inactive jobs as expired.
  - Periodically checks if active jobs are still available.
    ([job_manager.py](job_manager.py))
- **Data Storage**: Uses Supabase to store job data, resume details, and application statuses. (Utility functions in [supabase_utils.py](supabase_utils.py))
- **Custom PDF Resume Generation**: Generates ATS-friendly PDF resumes from structured resume data. ([pdf_generator.py](pdf_generator.py))
- **Resume Personalization**: Generates customized resumes using the legacy section-by-section personalization flow. ([custom_resume_generator.py](custom_resume_generator.py))
- **AI-Powered Text Processing**: Leverages any configured LLM for tasks like resume parsing and job description formatting.
- **Quota Management**: Built-in rate limiting, exponential backoff, and daily budget tracking for LLM API calls. Features dynamic model rotation (e.g., automatically switching between Gemini models) to bypass rate limitations.
- **Automated Workflows**: Includes optimized GitHub Actions for running tasks on a schedule without exhausting quotas. ([workflows](.github/workflows/))

## Setup and Installation

This project is designed to run primarily through GitHub Actions. Follow these steps to set it up for your own use:

1.  **Fork the Repository:**
    - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Create a Supabase Project:**
    - Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
    - Once your project is created, navigate to the "SQL Editor" section.
    - Open the `supabase_setup/init.sql` file from this repository, copy its content, and run it in your Supabase SQL Editor. This will set up the necessary tables (like `jobs`, `customized_resumes`, and `base_resume`) and storage buckets (`resumes`, `personalized_resumes`).

3.  **Obtain API Keys for Your LLM Provider:**
    - Get API key(s) from your chosen provider (e.g., [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), etc.).

4.  **Configure GitHub Repository Secrets and Variables:**
    - In your forked GitHub repository, go to "Settings".
    - In the left sidebar, navigate to "Secrets and variables" under the "Security" section, and then click on "Actions".
    - **Add Repository Secrets** (Click "New repository secret"):
      - `LLM_API_KEY`: Your primary LLM API key (e.g., for Gemini or Groq). Also accepts legacy `GEMINI_FIRST_API_KEY`.
      - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: (Optional) Your OpenAI API key if using GPT models.
      - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: (Optional) Your Anthropic API key if using Claude models.
      - `GROQ_API_KEY`: (Optional) Your Groq API key if using Groq models.
      - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase project's `service_role` key.
      - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project's URL.

    - > **Note:** Other non-sensitive variables like `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_MAX_RPM`, and `JOBS_TO_SCORE_PER_RUN` are now hardcoded in `config.py` as safe defaults. You only need to set them as GitHub Variables if you want to override the `config.py` defaults (though this is no longer the recommended approach).

5.  **Upload Your Resume to Supabase Storage:**
    - In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar.
    - Find the **`resumes`** bucket (created by the `init.sql` script in step 2).
    - Click on the bucket, then click **"Upload files"** and upload your resume. **The file must be named `resume.pdf`**.
    - > **⚠️ Security Note:** Your resume is stored securely in your private Supabase Storage bucket — it is **never committed to the public GitHub repository**. This protects your personal information (name, email, phone, address, etc.) from being publicly visible.

6.  **Parse Your Resume:**
    - Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked GitHub repository.
    - Find the workflow named "Parse Resume Manually" in the list of workflows.
    - Click on it, and then click the "Run workflow" button. This will trigger the `resume_parser.py` script, which will download your `resume.pdf` from Supabase Storage, parse it using AI, and store the structured data securely in the `base_resume` table in your Supabase database.

7.  **Configure Job Search Parameters (Edit `config.py`):**
    - In your forked GitHub repository, navigate to the [config.py](config.py) file.
    - Edit the file to customize your job search preferences. The main variables you'll likely want to change are:

      ```python
      # --- LinkedIn Search Configuration ---
      LINKEDIN_SEARCH_QUERIES = ["maths lecturer", "statistics lecturer"] # Your keywords
      LINKEDIN_LOCATION = "Singapore" # Target location
      LINKEDIN_GEO_ID = 102454443 # Geo ID (Singapore: 102454443, Dubai: 100205264)
      LINKEDIN_JOB_TYPE = "F" # "F" for Full-time
      LINKEDIN_JOB_POSTING_DATE = "r86400" # "r86400" for past 24 hours

      # --- Careers Future Search Configuration ---
      CAREERS_FUTURE_SEARCH_QUERIES = ["IT Support", "Full Stack Web Developer"]
      CAREERS_FUTURE_SEARCH_CATEGORIES = ["Information Technology"]

      # --- LLM configuration ---
      # For a full list of 100+ supported providers and model naming schemes, see:
      # https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers

      LLM_MODEL = "gemini"            # Model to use
      LLM_MAX_RPM = 10                # Max requests per minute
      LLM_REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS = 8   # Delay between calls

      # --- Processing Limits ---
      JOBS_TO_SCORE_PER_RUN = 1       # Scaled for free tier
      MAX_JOBS_PER_SEARCH = {
          "linkedin": 2,
          "careers_future": 10,
      }
      ```

    - **IMPORTANT**: Do not modify other variables in `config.py` as they are carefully calibrated to prevent rate limiting and potential account bans. Only edit the search queries and location parameters shown above.
    - Commit the changes to your `config.py` file in your repository.

8.  **Enable GitHub Actions:**
    - Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked GitHub repository.
    - You will see a message saying "Workflows aren't running on this repository". Click the "Enable Actions on this repository" button (or a similar prompt) to allow the scheduled workflows to run automatically.
    - Ensure all workflows listed (e.g., `scrape_jobs.yml`, `score_jobs.yml`, `job_manager.yml`) are enabled. If any are disabled, you may need to enable them individually.

## Automated Workflows

Once the setup is complete and GitHub Actions are enabled, the workflows defined in [workflows](.github/workflows/) are scheduled to run automatically:

- **`scrape_jobs.yml`**: Periodically scrapes new job postings from LinkedIn and CareersFuture based on your `config.py` settings and saves them to your Supabase database.
- **`score_jobs.yml`**: Periodically scores the newly scraped jobs and jobs with custom resumes against your parsed resume / custom resume and updates the scores in the database.
- **`job_manager.yml`**: Periodically manages job statuses (e.g., marks old jobs as expired, checks if active jobs are still available).
- **`hourly_resume_customization.yml`**: (If enabled and configured) May run tasks related to customizing resumes for specific jobs.

You can monitor the execution of these actions in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

## Usage

After the initial setup and the "Parse Resume Manually" action has successfully run, the system will operate automatically through the scheduled GitHub Actions.

You can interact with the data directly through your Supabase dashboard to view scraped jobs, your parsed resume, and job scores.

### Web Interface for Viewing Data

A Next.js web application is available to view and manage the scraped jobs, your resume details, and job scores from the database.

- **Repository:** [jobs-scrapper-web](https://github.com/anandanair/jobs-scraper-web)
- **Setup:** To use the web interface, clone the `jobs-scrapper-web` repository and follow the setup instructions provided in its `README.md` file to run it locally. This will typically involve configuring it to connect to your Supabase instance.

The individual Python scripts can still be run locally for development or testing, but this requires setting up a local Python environment, installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and creating a local `.env` file with the necessary credentials (mirroring the GitHub secrets).

**Local Development Setup (Optional):**

1.  **Clone your forked repository locally:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anandanair/linkedin-jobs-scrapper
    cd linkedin-jobs-scrapper
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    playwright install # Install browser drivers for Playwright
    ```
4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    - In the root of your local repository, create a `.env` file.
    - Add the keys and values that you configured as GitHub secrets:

      ```env
      # Essential Keys
      LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_LLM_API_KEY"
      SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
      SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"

      # Note: LLM settings (MODEL, RPM, etc.) can be configured in config.py
      ```

5.  **Run scripts locally (example):**
    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    python resume_parser.py
    python score_jobs.py
    python job_manager.py
    ```
